        <h1>Moody Blues</h1>

        <p>Their second album, Days of Future Passed, which was released in 1967, 
            was a fusion of rock with classical music which established the band as 
            pioneers in the development of art rock and progressive rock.[2][9] 
            It has been described as a "landmark" and "one of the first successful 
            concept albums".[2] The group toured extensively through the early 1970s, 
            then took an extended hiatus from 1974 until 1977. Founder Mike Pinder left 
            the group a year after they re-formed and was replaced by Swiss keyboardist 
            Patrick Moraz in 1978. In the following decade they took on a more synth-pop 
            sound and produced The Other Side of Life in 1986, which made them the first act 
            to earn each of its first three top 10 singles in the United States in a different 
            decade.[10] Health troubles led to a diminished role for founder Ray Thomas 
            throughout the 1980s, though his musical contributions rebounded after Moraz 
            departed in 1991. Thomas retired from the band in 2002.

        <h2>Listen to this classic!!!</h2>

        <p>
            When reissued in 1972, in the United States the single hit number two – 
            for two weeks – on the Billboard Hot 100 (behind "I Can See Clearly Now" 
            by Johnny Nash) and hit number one on the Cash Box Top 100. It earned a gold 
            certification for sales of over a million US copies. It also hit number one in Canada. 
            After two weeks at #2, it was replaced by "I'd Love You to Want Me" by Lobo. It reached 
            its highest UK position this year at number 9. Although the song did not enter the official 
            New Zealand chart, it reached #5 on the New Zealand Listener's chart compiled from the readers' 
            votes in 1973.[4]
